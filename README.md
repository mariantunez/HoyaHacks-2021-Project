My Distance is a portable device that can be adapted to blind peoples canes to help them maintain a 6ft distance from others. 
It emits a vibration to let them when they are getting to close to someone else and avoid them getting into other people space by mistake. 
We intend that with this device they could can now stand in a line, take public transportation, cross the street or simply with the confident that they are not mistakenly invading someone else space and at the same time protecting their own.
